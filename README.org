* General
This branch of the repo will be actively maintained until the thesis is finished. After that it will be archived like the original from [[https://github.com/mrdavidkovacs/FHWNMasterThesis][David Kovacs]] to serve as a template for future FHWN students searching for a ready to go LaTeX template.

* Contents
This repository contains my master thesis proposal, thesis and the presentation.
