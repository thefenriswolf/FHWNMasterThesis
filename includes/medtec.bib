  abstract = {Abstract             Medical image segmentation is one of the bases of development in the field of personalized medicine, which allows the reconstruction of parts of the human body to produce virtual models by classifying pixels to create a surface or volume with similar properties. This work is focused on image segmentation through open-source software for bone structure analysis using the finite element method. According to this approach, the aim of this study is to investigate the sequential process, based on the features and requirements of the reconstruction software, to assess the segmentation tools and provide a comparative analysis. The methodology focuses on the software that has been documented for the anatomical reconstruction of organs and tissues, accounting for algorithms of manual, semi-automatic and automatic handling. Three segmentation packages are analyzed: 3D Slicer with a semi-automatic process called Region Growing, ITK-Snap with its interactive mechanism Active Contour segmentation mode, and, finally, In Vesalius with its automatic segmentation technique that identifies types of tissues and a simplified user-machine interface. A comparison is proposed based on the ease of the workflow, time for completion, the robustness of the tool, and precision of the semi-automatic and automatic methods, as opposed to the manual process, by statistic deviations and volume error obtained with Cloud Compare. The segmentation of a vertebra obtained from a DICOM© file in a computerized axial tomography was completed, and performance indicators were evaluated. The results showed that 3D Slicer - Grow from seeds is the best option to make the segmentation with a 9.59\% of volume error and the fastest process among others.},

  abstract = {In remote sensing applications, segmentation of input satellite images according to semantic information and estimating the semantic category of each pixel from a given set of tags are of great importance for the automatic tracking task. It is important in situations such as building detection from high resolution satellite images, city planning, environmental preparation, disaster management. Buildings in metropolitan areas are crowded and messy, so high-resolution images from satellites need to be automated to detect buildings. Segmentation of remote sensing images with deep learning technology has been a widely considered area of research. The Fully Convolutional Network (FCN) model, a popular segmentation model, is used for building detection based on pixel-level satellite images. In the U-Net model developed for biomedical image segmentation and modified in our study, its performances during training, accuracy and testing were compared by using customized loss functions such as Dice Coefficient and Jaccard Index measurements. Dice Coefficient loss score was obtained 84\% and Jaccard Index lost score was obtained 70\%. In addition, the Dice Coefficient loss score increased from 84\% to 87\% by using the Batch Normalization (BN) method instead of the Dropout method in the model.},

  abstract = {Purpose: Demonstrate noninvasive imaging methods for in vivo characterization of cardiac structure and function in mice using a micro-CT system that provides high photon fluence rate and integrated motion control. Materials and Methods: Simultaneous cardiac- and respiratory-gated micro-CT was performed in C57BL/6 mice during constant intravenous infusion of a conventional iodinated contrast agent (Isovue-370), and after a single intravenous injection of a blood pool contrast agent (Fenestra VC). Multiple phases of the cardiac cycle were reconstructed with contrast to noise and spatial resolution sufficient for quantitative assessment of cardiac function. Results: Contrast enhancement with Isovue-370 increased over time with a maximum of \textasciitilde 500 HU (aorta) and 900 HU (kidney cortex). Fenestra VC provided more constant enhancement over 3 hr, with maximum enhancement of \textasciitilde 620 HU (aorta) and \textasciitilde 90 HU (kidney cortex). The maximum enhancement difference between blood and myocardium in the heart was \textasciitilde 250 HU for Isovue-370 and \textasciitilde 500 HU for Fenestra VC. In mice with Fenestra VC, volumetric measurements of the left ventricle were performed and cardiac function was estimated by ejection fraction, stroke volume, and cardiac output. Conclusion: Image quality with Fenestra VC was sufficient for morphological and functional studies required for a standardized method of cardiac phenotyping of the mouse.},

  abstract = {Few studies have directly compared passive scattering (PS) to intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) in the delivery of ultra-hypofractionated proton beams to the localized prostate cancer (PCa). In this preliminary study involving five patients previously treated with CyberKnife, treatment plans were created for PS and IMPT (36.25 CGE in five fractions with two opposing fields) to compare the dosimetric parameters to the planning target volume (PTV) and organs-at-risk (OAR: rectum, bladder, femoral heads). Both plans met the acceptance criteria. Significant differences were observed in the minimum and maximum doses to the PTV. The mean dose to the PTV was lower for PS (35.62 ± 0.26 vs. 37.18 ± 0.14; p = 0.002). Target coverage (D98\%) was better for IMPT (96.79\% vs. 99.10\%; p = 0.004). IMPT resulted in significantly lower mean doses to the rectum (16.75 CGE vs. 6.88 CGE; p = 0.004) and bladder (17.69 CGE vs. 5.98 CGE p = 0.002). High dose to the rectum (V36.25 CGE) were lower with PS, but not significantly opposite to high dose to the bladder. No significant differences were observed in mean conformity index values, with a non-significant trend towards higher mean homogeneity index values for PS. Non-significant differences in the gamma index for both fields were observed. These findings suggest that both PS and IMPT ultra-hypofractionated proton therapy for PCa are highly precise, offering good target coverage and sparing of normal tissues and OARs.},

This study aimed to investigate the potential of               range guidance               using water-equivalent path length (WEPL) calculations to detect dose degradations occurring in PT.               Materials and methods:               Proton ranges were estimated using WEPL calculations. Field-specific isodose surfaces in the planning CT (pCT), from robustly optimised five-field proton plans (opposing lateral and three posterior/posterior oblique beams) for locally advanced prostate cancer patients, were used as starting points. WEPLs to each point on the field-specific isodoses in the pCT were calculated. The corresponding range for each point was found in the repeat CTs (rCTs). The spatial agreement between the resulting surfaces in the rCTs (hereafter referred to as iso-WEPLs) and the isodoses re-calculated in rCTs was evaluated for different dose levels and Hausdorff thresholds (2-5 mm). Finally, the sensitivity and specificity of detecting target dose degradation (V95\%{$<$}95\%) using spatial agreement measures between the iso-WEPLs and isodoses in the pCT was evaluated.               Results:               The spatial agreement between the iso-WEPLs and isodoses in the rCTs depended on the Hausdorff threshold. The agreement was 65-88\% for a 2 mm threshold, 83-96\% for 3 mm, 90-99\% for 4 mm, and 94-99\% for 5 mm, across all fields and isodose levels. Minor differences were observed between the different isodose levels investigated. Target dose degradations were detected with 82-100\% sensitivity and 75-80\% specificity using a 2 mm Hausdorff threshold for the lateral fields.               Conclusion:               Iso-WEPLs were comparable to isodoses re-calculated in the rCTs. The proposed strategy could detect target dose degradations occurring in the rCTs and could be an alternative to a fully-fledged dose re-calculation to detect anatomical variations severely influencing the proton range.},

Both imaging methods are non-destructive and perform optical sectioning, respectively, with X-rays and laser light. MicroCT can be used on fresh or fixed tissue samples and is primarily designed to image bone rather than soft tissues. It requires complex back-projection algorithms to produce a two-dimensional image, and it is an expensive instrument. sTSLIM requires that a specimen be chemically fixed, decalcified, and cleared; but it produces high-resolution images of soft and bony tissues with minimum image postprocessing and is less expensive than microCT. In this article, we discuss the merits and disadvantages of each method individually and when combined.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The Sørensen-Dice index (SDI) is a widely used measure for evaluating medical image segmentation algorithms. It offers a standardized measure of segmentation accuracy which has proven useful. However, it offers diminishing insight when the number of objects is unknown, such as in white matter lesion segmentation of multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. We present a refinement for finer grained parsing of SDI results in situations where the number of objects is unknown. We explore these ideas with two case studies showing what can be learned from our two presented studies. Our first study explores an inter-rater comparison, showing that smaller lesions cannot be reliably identified. In our second case study, we demonstrate fusing multiple MS lesion segmentation algorithms based on the insights into the algorithms provided by our analysis to generate a segmentation that exhibits improved performance. This work demonstrates the wealth of information that can be learned from refined analysis of medical image segmentations.},

  abstract = {The Hounsfield unit (HU) is a relative quantitative measurement of radio density used by radiologists in the interpretation of computed tomography (CT) images. The absorption/attenuation coefficient of radiation within a tissue is used during CT reconstruction to produce a grayscale image. The physical density of tissue is proportional to the absorption/attenuation of the X-ray beam. The Hounsfield unit, also referred to as the CT unit, is then calculated based on a linear transformation of the baseline linear attenuation coefficient of the X-ray beam, where distilled water (at standard temperature and pressure) is arbitrarily defined to be zero Hounsfield Units and air defined as -1000 HU. The upper limits can reach up to 1000 for bones, 2000 for dense bones like the cochlea, and more than 3000 for metals like steel or silver. The linear transformation produces a Hounsfield scale that displays as gray tones. More dense tissue, with greater X-ray beam absorption, has positive values and appears bright; less dense tissue, with less X-ray beam absorption, has negative values and appears dark. The Hounsfield unit was named after Sir Godfrey Hounsfield, recipient of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1979, for his part in the invention of CT, as it had immediate recognition as a revolutionary diagnostic instrument.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Complex morphological traits are the product of many genes with transient or lasting developmental effects that interact in anatomical context. Mouse models are a key resource for disentangling such effects, because they offer myriad tools for manipulating the genome in a controlled environment. Unfortunately, phenotypic data are often obtained using laboratory-specific protocols, resulting in self-contained datasets that are difficult to relate to one another for larger scale analyses. To enable meta-analyses of morphological variation, particularly in the craniofacial complex and brain, we created MusMorph, a database of standardized mouse morphology data spanning numerous genotypes and developmental stages, including E10.5, E11.5, E14.5, E15.5, E18.5, and adulthood. To standardize data collection, we implemented an atlas-based phenotyping pipeline that combines techniques from image registration, deep learning, and morphometrics. Alongside stage-specific atlases, we provide aligned micro-computed tomography images, dense anatomical landmarks, and segmentations (if available) for each specimen (               N               \,=\,10,056). Our workflow is open-source to encourage transparency and reproducible data collection. The MusMorph data and scripts are available on FaceBase (               www.facebase.org               ,               https://doi.org/10.25550/3-HXMC               ) and GitHub (               https://github.com/jaydevine/MusMorph               ).},

Materials and methods                                In total, 171 scans from scan-rescan experiments on three healthy subjects were analyzed. Each subject received 3D-T1-weighted brain MRI scans at increasing degrees of acceleration (CS-factor\,=\,1/4/8/12/16/20/32). Single-scan acquisition times ranged from 00:41~min (CS-factor\,=\,32) to 21:52~min (CS-factor\,=\,1). Brain segmentation and volumetry was performed using two different software tools:                 md.brain                 , a proprietary software based on voxel-based morphometry, and                 FreeSurfer                 , an open-source software based on surface-based morphometry. Four sub-volumes were analyzed: brain parenchyma (BP), total gray matter, total white matter, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Coefficient of variation (CoV) of the repeated measurements as a measure of intra-subject reliability was calculated. Intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) with regard to increasing CS-factor was calculated as another measure of reliability. Noise-to-contrast ratio as a measure of image quality was calculated for each dataset to analyze the association between acceleration factor, noise and volumetric brain measurements.                                                        Results               For all sub-volumes, there is a systematic bias proportional to the CS-factor which is dependent on the utilized software and subvolume. Measured volumes deviated significantly from the reference standard (CS-factor\,=\,1), e.g. ranging from 1 to 13\% for BP. The CS-induced systematic bias is driven by increased image noise. Except for CSF, reliability of brain volumetry remains high, demonstrated by low CoV ({$<$}\,1\% for CS-factor up to 20) and good to excellent ICC for CS-factor up to 12.                                         Conclusion               CS-acceleration has a systematic biasing effect on volumetric brain measurements.},

MicroCT imaging is non-destructive and combines well with other modalities such as light and electron microscopy in correlative imaging workflows. Protocols for staining embryos with X-ray dense contrast agents enable the acquisition of high-contrast and high-resolution datasets of whole embryos and specific organ systems. High sample throughput is achieved with dedicated setups. Consequently, microCT has gained enormous importance for both qualitative and quantitative phenotyping of mouse development. We here summarize state-of-the-art protocols of sample preparation and imaging procedures, showcase contemporary applications, and discuss possible pitfalls and sources for artefacts. In addition, we give an outlook on phenotyping workflows using microscopic dual energy CT (microDECT) and tissue-specific contrast agents.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Array programming provides a powerful, compact and expressive syntax for accessing, manipulating and operating on data in vectors, matrices and higher-dimensional arrays. NumPy is the primary array programming library for the Python language. It has an essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology, psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and economics. For example, in astronomy, NumPy was an important part of the software stack used in the discovery of gravitational waves               1               and in the first imaging of a black hole               2               . Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an interoperability layer between such array computation libraries and, together with its application programming interface (API), provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of scientific and industrial analysis.},

Geriatric diseases are characterized by a long course of the disease, slow recovery, and high medical costs. Therefore, a simple, rapid, economical, and effective method is urgently needed to detect the indicators of patients for long-term and continuous monitoring to reduce the medical burden. Wearable sensors, with their advantages of real-time, economical, simple operation, and non-invasion have attracted extensive attention and have good application potential in the health monitoring of elderly patients and the development of intelligent auxiliary devices. This paper reviews the research progress of skin-like wearable sensors in health monitoring and intelligent auxiliary devices in recent years. According to different sensing mechanisms, this paper introduces skin-like wearable sensors for health monitoring, including electrochemistry, bioimpedance, photoelectricity, and other wearable sensors, as well as related research for the development of intelligent auxiliary devices. Finally, this paper summarizes the applications and future challenges of developing the skin-like wearable sensor into a widely used and accepted home medical device for elderly patients.},

  abstract = {Background and Purpose—               Perihematomal edema (PHE) is a promising surrogate marker of secondary brain injury in patients with spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage, but it can be challenging to accurately and rapidly quantify. The aims of this study are to derive and internally validate a fully automated segmentation algorithm for volumetric analysis of PHE.                                         Methods—               Inpatient computed tomography scans of 400 consecutive adults with spontaneous, supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage enrolled in the Intracerebral Hemorrhage Outcomes Project (2009–2018) were separated into training (n=360) and test (n=40) datasets. A fully automated segmentation algorithm was derived from manual segmentations in the training dataset using convolutional neural networks, and its performance was compared with that of manual and semiautomated segmentation methods in the test dataset.                                         Results—                                The mean volumetric dice similarity coefficients for the fully automated segmentation algorithm were 0.838±0.294 and 0.843±0.293 with manual and semiautomated segmentation methods as reference standards, respectively. PHE volumes derived from the fully automated versus manual (r=0.959;                 P                 {$<$}0.0001), fully automated versus semiautomated (r=0.960;                 P                 {$<$}0.0001), and semiautomated versus manual (r=0.961;                 P                 {$<$}0.0001) segmentation methods had strong between-group correlations. The fully automated segmentation algorithm (mean 18.0±1.8 seconds/scan) quantified PHE volumes at a significantly faster rate than both of the manual (mean 316.4±168.8 seconds/scan;                 P                 {$<$}0.0001) and semiautomated (mean 480.5±295.3 seconds/scan;                 P                 {$<$}0.0001) segmentation methods.                                                        Conclusions—               The fully automated segmentation algorithm accurately quantified PHE volumes from computed tomography scans of supratentorial intracerebral hemorrhage patients with high fidelity and greater efficiency compared with manual and semiautomated segmentation methods. External validation of fully automated segmentation for assessment of PHE is warranted.},

Current standard for volumetric measurement of xenografted tumors is by external caliper, a method often affected by error. The aim of the present study was to evaluate if microCT gives more accurate and reproducible measures of tumor size in mice compared with caliper measurements. Furthermore, we evaluated the accuracy of tumor volume determined from                 18                 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (                 18                 F-FDG) PET.                                                        Methods                                Subcutaneously implanted human breast adenocarcinoma cells in NMRI nude mice served as tumor model. Tumor volume (n = 20) was determined                 in vivo                 by external caliper, microCT and                 18                 F-FDG-PET and subsequently reference volume was determined                 ex vivo                 . Intra-observer reproducibility of the microCT and caliper methods were determined by acquiring 10 repeated volume measurements. Volumes of a group of tumors (n = 10) were determined independently by two observers to assess inter-observer variation.                                                        Results               Tumor volume measured by microCT, PET and caliper all correlated with reference volume. No significant bias of microCT measurements compared with the reference was found, whereas both PET and caliper had systematic bias compared to reference volume. Coefficients of variation for intra-observer variation were 7\% and 14\% for microCT and caliper measurements, respectively. Regression coefficients between observers were 0.97 for microCT and 0.91 for caliper measurements.                                         Conclusion                                MicroCT was more accurate than both caliper and                 18                 F-FDG-PET for                 in vivo                 volumetric measurements of subcutaneous tumors in mice.                 18                 F-FDG-PET was considered unsuitable for determination of tumor size. External caliper were inaccurate and encumbered with a significant and size dependent bias. MicroCT was also the most reproducible of the methods.},

Exposure to this technology within medical schools and hospitals remains limited in the United Kingdom. M3dicube UK, a national medical student, and junior doctor‐led 3DP interest group piloted a 3D image segmentation workshop to gauge the impact of incorporating 3D segmentation technology on anatomical education. The workshop, piloted with medical students and doctors within the United Kingdom between September 2020 and 2021, introduced participants to 3D segmentation and offered practical experience segmenting anatomical models. Thirty‐three participants were recruited, with 33 pre‐workshop and 24 post‐workshop surveys completed. Two‐tailed               t               ‐tests were used to compare mean scores. From pre‐ to post‐workshop, increases were noted in participants' confidence in interpreting CT scans (2.36 to 3.13,               p               \,=\,0.010) and interacting with 3D printing technology (2.15 to 3.33,               p               \,=\,0.00053), perceived utility of creating 3D models to aid image interpretation (4.18 to 4.45,               p               \,=\,0.0027), improved anatomical understanding (4.2 to 4.7,               p               \,=\,0.0018), and utility in medical education (4.45 to 4.79,               p               \,=\,0.077). This pilot study provides early evidence of the utility of exposing medical students and healthcare professionals in the United Kingdom to 3D segmentation as part of their anatomical education, with additional benefit in imaging interpretation ability.},

Micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) is a non-destructive imaging technique that allows the rapid digitisation of internal and external structures of a sample in three dimensions and with great resolution. In this review, the strengths and weaknesses of some common imaging techniques applied in biological and biomedical fields, such as optical microscopy, confocal laser scanning microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy, are presented and compared with the micro-CT technique through five use cases. Finally, the ability of micro-CT to create non-destructively 3D anatomical and morphological data in sub-micron resolution and the necessity to develop complementary methods with other imaging techniques, in order to overcome limitations caused by each technique, is emphasised.},

  abstract = {Hypothesis We investigated differences in severe radiation-induced lymphopenia (SRL) after pencil beam scanning proton therapy (PBSPT) or intensity-modulated (photon) radiotherapy (IMRT) for patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Methods We retrospectively reviewed 223 patients who received definitive concurrent chemoradiotherapy with PBSPT (n~=~29) or IMRT (n~=~194). SRL was defined when ≥2 events of absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) of {$<$}200 cells/μL were observed in weekly laboratory tests conducted during treatment. Stepwise multivariate logistic regression with 10-fold cross-validation was performed to identify predictive values of SRL. Furthermore, 1:2 propensity score matching (PSM) analysis was performed between the PBSPT and IMRT groups. Results Baseline ALC was comparable between the PBSPT and IMRT groups (median, 2130 vs. 2040 cells/μL; p~=~0.983). Lung volumes receiving~≥~5–20 GyE and the mean dose were significantly lower in patients receiving PBSPT than those receiving IMRT (p~{$<~$}0.001). Among 72 (32.3\%) patients with SRL; 69 (95.8\%) and 3 (4.2\%) patients were treated with IMRT and PBSPT, respectively. After multivariable analysis, PBSPT reduced SRL compared to IMRT (odds ratio [OR] 0.13, p~=~0.003). Specifically, lung V5Gy were identified as the strongest predictor of SRL before (OR 1.11) and after PSM (OR, 1.07) (p~{$<~$}0.05). With a median follow-up of 23.0~months, the 2-year overall survival in patients with SRL was worse than that those without SRL (63.4\% vs. 79.9\%; p~=~0.003). Conclusions Reduced irradiated lung volumes of PBSPT consequently reduced SRL. In addition, lung V5Gy contributed to the SRL. Reduction of SRL through the optimized RT might be essential to improve the outcomes.},

Panoptic segmentation unifies the typically distinct tasks of semantic segmentation (assign a class label to each pixel) and instance segmentation (detect and segment each object instance). The proposed task requires generating a coherent scene segmentation that is rich and complete, an important step toward real-world vision systems. While early work in computer vision addressed related image/scene parsing tasks, these are not currently popular, possibly due to lack of appropriate metrics or associated recognition challenges. To address this, we propose a novel panoptic quality (PQ) metric that captures performance for all classes (stuff and things) in an interpretable and unified manner. Using the proposed metric, we perform a rigorous study of both human and machine performance for PS on three existing datasets, revealing interesting insights about the task. The aim of our work is to revive the interest of the community in a more unified view of image segmentation.},

Lateral setup errors of 0.5 cm are tolerated in 1 × 1 cm                 2                 fields, but beam incidence must be kept as close to normal as possible. Calibration in 10 × 10 fields is not recommended because of the                 LAC                 's over‐response. The accuracy of relative point‐dose measurements in the field's periphery is an important limiting factor for the accuracy of                 DAP                 w                 measurements.},

The model has demonstrated that, with efficient prompting, it can create high-quality, generalized masks for image segmentation. However, the performance of the model on medical images requires further validation. To assist with the development, assessment, and application of SAM on medical images, we introduce Segment Any Medical Model (SAMM), an extension of SAM on 3D Slicer - an open-source image processing and visualization software extensively used by the medical imaging community. This open-source extension to 3D Slicer and its demonstrations are posted on GitHub (https://github.com/bingogome/samm). SAMM achieves 0.6-second latency of a complete cycle and can infer image masks in nearly real-time.},

  abstract = {Wearables are a multi-billion-dollar business with more growth expected. Wearable technology is fully entrenched at multiple levels of athletic competition, especially at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and professional levels where these solutions are used to gain competitive advantages by assessing health and performance of elite athletes. However, through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) training experience, a different story emerged based on pilot interviews from coaches and trainers regarding the lack of trust in wearables, and how the technology falls short of measuring what practitioners need. An NSF I-Corps project was funded to interview over 100 strength and conditioning coaches (S\&CCs) and athletic trainers (ATs) regarding the current state of wearables at the NCAA and professional levels. Through 113 unstructured interviews, a conceptual map of relationships amongst themes and sub-themes regarding wearable technology emerged through the grouping of responses into meaning units (MUs). Interview findings revealed that discussions by S\&CCs and ATs regarding wearables could be grouped into themes tied to (a) the organizational environment, (b) the athlete, and (c) the analyst or data scientist. Through this project, key findings and lessons learned were aggregated into sub-themes including: the sports ecosystem and organizational structure, brand development, recruiting, compliance and gamification of athletes, baselining movement and injury mitigation, internal and external loads, “return tos,” and quantifying performance. These findings can be used by practitioners to understand general technology practices and where to close the gap between what is available versus what is needed.},

  abstract = {Summary             Objectives:            Wearable systems can be broadly defined as mobile electronic devices that can be unobtrusively embedded in the user’s outfit as part of the clothing or an accessory. In particular, unlike conventional mobile systems, they can be operational and accessed without or with very little hindrance to user activity. To this end they are able to model and recognize user activity, state, and the surrounding situation: a property, referred to as context sensitivity. Wearable systems range from micro sensors seamlessly integrated in textiles through consumer electronics embedded in fashionable clothes and computerized watches to belt worn PCs with a head mounted display. The wearable computing concept is part of a broader framework of ubiquitous computing that aims at invisibly enhancing our environment with smart electronic devices.             The goal of the paper is to provide a broad overview of wearable technology and its implications for health related applications.             Methods:            We begin by summarizing the vision behind wearable computing. We then describe a framework for wearable computing architecture and the main technological aspects. Finally we show how specific properties of wearable systems can be used in different health related application domains.             Results:            Wearable computing is an emerging concept building upon the success of today’s mobile computing and communication devices. Due to rapid technological progress it is currently making a transition from a pure research stage to practical applications. Many of those applications are in health related domains, in particular, health monitoring, mobile treatment and nursing.             Conclusions:            Within the next couple of years wearable systems and more general ubiquitous computing will introduce profound changes and new application types to health related systems. In particular they will prove useful in improving the quality and reducing the cost of caring for the aging population.},

  abstract = {Background               With the rise of mobile medicine, the development of new technologies such as smart sensing, and the popularization of personalized health concepts, the field of smart wearable devices has developed rapidly in recent years. Among them, medical wearable devices have become one of the most promising fields. These intelligent devices not only assist people in pursuing a healthier lifestyle but also provide a constant stream of health care data for disease diagnosis and treatment by actively recording physiological parameters and tracking metabolic status. Therefore, wearable medical devices have the potential to become a mainstay of the future mobile medical market.                                         Objective               Although previous reviews have discussed consumer trends in wearable electronics and the application of wearable technology in recreational and sporting activities, data on broad clinical usefulness are lacking. We aimed to review the current application of wearable devices in health care while highlighting shortcomings for further research. In addition to daily health and safety monitoring, the focus of our work was mainly on the use of wearable devices in clinical practice.                                         Methods               We conducted a narrative review of the use of wearable devices in health care settings by searching papers in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library published since October 2015. Potentially relevant papers were then compared to determine their relevance and reviewed independently for inclusion.                                         Results               A total of 82 relevant papers drawn from 960 papers on the subject of wearable devices in health care settings were qualitatively analyzed, and the information was synthesized. Our review shows that the wearable medical devices developed so far have been designed for use on all parts of the human body, including the head, limbs, and torso. These devices can be classified into 4 application areas: (1) health and safety monitoring, (2) chronic disease management, (3) disease diagnosis and treatment, and (4) rehabilitation. However, the wearable medical device industry currently faces several important limitations that prevent further use of wearable technology in medical practice, such as difficulties in achieving user-friendly solutions, security and privacy concerns, the lack of industry standards, and various technical bottlenecks.                                         Conclusions               We predict that with the development of science and technology and the popularization of personalized health concepts, wearable devices will play a greater role in the field of health care and become better integrated into people’s daily lives. However, more research is needed to explore further applications of wearable devices in the medical field. We hope that this review can provide a useful reference for the development of wearable medical devices.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            For image-guided small animal irradiations, the whole workflow of imaging, organ contouring, irradiation planning, and delivery is typically performed in a single session requiring continuous administration of anaesthetic agents. Automating contouring leads to a faster workflow, which limits exposure to anaesthesia and thereby, reducing its impact on experimental results and on animal wellbeing. Here, we trained the 2D and 3D U-Net architectures of no-new-Net (nnU-Net) for autocontouring of the thorax in mouse micro-CT images. We trained the models only on native CTs and evaluated their performance using an independent testing dataset (i.e., native CTs not included in the training and validation). Unlike previous studies, we also tested the model performance on an external dataset (i.e., contrast-enhanced CTs) to see how well they predict on CTs completely different from what they were trained on. We also assessed the interobserver variability using the generalized conformity index (                                                   \$\$\textbackslash hbox \{CI\}\_\{\textbackslash mathrm\{gen\}\}\$\$                                                               CI                       gen                                                                                       ) among three observers, providing a stronger human baseline for evaluating automated contours than previous studies. Lastly, we showed the benefit on the contouring time compared to manual contouring. The results show that 3D models of nnU-Net achieve superior segmentation accuracy and are more robust to unseen data than 2D models. For all target organs, the mean surface distance (MSD) and the Hausdorff distance (95p HD) of the best performing model for this task (nnU-Net 3d\_fullres) are within 0.16 mm and 0.60 mm, respectively. These values are below the minimum required contouring accuracy of 1 mm for small animal irradiations, and improve significantly upon state-of-the-art 2D U-Net-based AIMOS method. Moreover, the conformity indices of the 3d\_fullres model also compare favourably to the interobserver variability for all target organs, whereas the 2D models perform poorly in this regard. Importantly, the 3d\_fullres model offers 98\% reduction in contouring time.},

  abstract = {In hip arthroplasty, preoperative planning is fundamental to reaching a successful surgery. Nowadays, several software tools for computed tomography (CT) image processing are available. However, research studies comparing segmentation tools for hip surgery planning for patients affected by osteoarthritic diseases or osteoporotic fractures are still lacking. The present work compares three different software from the geometric, dimensional, and usability perspectives to identify the best three-dimensional (3D) modelling tool for the reconstruction of pathological femoral heads. Syngo.via Frontier (by Siemens Healthcare) is a medical image reading and post-processing software that allows low-skilled operators to produce prototypes. Materialise (by Mimics) is a commercial medical modelling software. 3D Slicer (by slicer.org) is an open-source development platform used in medical and biomedical fields. The 3D models reconstructed starting from the in vivo CT images of the pathological femoral head are compared with the geometries obtained from the laser scan of the in vitro bony specimens. The results show that Mimics and 3D Slicer are better for dimensional and geometric accuracy in the 3D reconstruction, while syngo.via Frontier is the easiest to use in the hospital setting.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE:               To design, develop, and evaluate a simple, understandable medicine label and patient information leaflet (PIL) for nystatin suspension, and to assess the effect of incorporating pictograms on understanding in low-literate participants.                                         METHODS:                                Patient information materials were designed and pretested in a pilot study (n = 20), and were subjected to the Fry's readability test. The final evaluation was conducted with 60 low-literate participants who had a maximum of 7 years of formal schooling and for whom English was their second language. Demographic data were collected. Participants were randomly allocated to a control (text-only information) or experimental (text + pictogram information) group, shown the medicine label and PIL, and asked to read them. A series of questions was asked about the instructions and an understanding level was calculated in each case. A second series of questions assessed patient acceptability of the materials. Differences in understanding were determined by χ                 2                 tests.                                                        RESULTS:               Both sets of these simple written materials were generally well understood. However, the presence of pictograms was shown to improve the comprehension of more complex information, resulting in significantly more participants in the experimental group obtaining a score for understanding {$>$}80\% for both the medicine label and PIL. A clear preference for the materials incorporating pictograms was expressed.                                         CONCLUSIONS:               The presence of pictograms had a positive effect in the acquisition and comprehension of drug information.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we discuss the role of particle therapy—a novel radiation therapy (RT) that has shown rapid progress and widespread use in recent years—in multidisciplinary treatment. Three types of particle therapies are currently used for cancer treatment: proton beam therapy (PBT), carbon-ion beam therapy (CIBT), and boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). PBT and CIBT have been reported to have excellent therapeutic results owing to the physical characteristics of their Bragg peaks. Variable drug therapies, such as chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and immunotherapy, are combined in various treatment strategies, and treatment effects have been improved. BNCT has a high dose concentration for cancer in terms of nuclear reactions with boron. BNCT is a next-generation RT that can achieve cancer cell-selective therapeutic effects, and its effectiveness strongly depends on the selective 10B accumulation in cancer cells by concomitant boron preparation. Therefore, drug delivery research, including nanoparticles, is highly desirable. In this review, we introduce both clinical and basic aspects of particle beam therapy from the perspective of multidisciplinary treatment, which is expected to expand further in the future.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Throughout the last years, carbon‐fibre‐reinforced PEEK (CFP) pedicle screw systems were introduced to replace standard titanium alloy (Ti) implants for spinal instrumentation, promising improved radiotherapy (RT) treatment planning accuracy. We compared the dosimetric impact of both implants for intensity modulated proton (IMPT) and volumetric arc photon therapy (VMAT), with the focus on uncertainties in Hounsfield unit assignment of titanium alloy.                                         Methods               Retrospective planning was performed on CT data of five patients with Ti and five with CFP implants. Carbon‐fibre‐reinforced PEEK systems comprised radiolucent pedicle screws with thin titanium‐coated regions and titanium tulips. For each patient, one IMPT and one VMAT plan were generated with a nominal relative stopping power (SP) (IMPT) and electron density (ρ) (VMAT) and recalculated onto the identical CT with increased and decreased SP or ρ by ±6\% for the titanium components.                                         Results               Recalculated VMAT dose distributions hardly deviated from the nominal plans for both screw types. IMPT plans resulted in more heterogeneous target coverage, measured by the standard deviation σ inside the target, which increased on average by 7.6~±~2.3\% (Ti) vs 3.4~±~1.2\% (CFP). Larger SPs lead to lower target minimum doses, lower SPs to higher dose maxima, with a more pronounced effect for Ti screws.                                         Conclusions               While VMAT plans showed no relevant difference in dosimetric quality between both screw types, IMPT plans demonstrated the benefit of CFP screws through a smaller dosimetric impact of CT‐value uncertainties compared to Ti. Reducing metal components in implants will therefore improve dose calculation accuracy and lower the risk for tumor underdosage.},

To identify machine‐specific reference (                 msr                 ) fields and plan‐class specific reference (                 pcsr                 ) fields consistent with the definitions given by Alfonso                 et al.                 To review the literature of beam monitor calibration in scanned beams using three different methods in terms of this common formalism.                                                        Methods                                Four types of                 msr                 fields are identified as those that are meant to calibrate the beam monitor for scanned beams with particular energies. Two types of                 pcsr                 fields are identified as those that are meant to apply one or more tuning factors to the entire delivery chain.                                                        Results               The formalism establishes the energy‐dependent relation between the number of particles incident on the phantom surface and the beam monitor reading and distinguishes three routes to determine the beam monitor calibration function: (i) the use of a calibrated reference ionization chamber in a single‐layer scanned beam, (ii) the use of a cross‐calibrated large‐area parallel plate ionization chamber in a single‐energy beamlet, and (iii) the use of a calibrated reference ionization chamber in a box field to adjust a calibration curve obtained by a Faraday cup or an ionization chamber. Examples of all three methods and comparisons between them from the literature are analysed.                                         Conclusions               The formalism can form the basis of future dosimetry recommendations for scanned particle beams and the analysis of the literature data in terms of this formalism can form the basis of data compilations for the application of the dosimetry procedures.},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) micro-tomography (µ-CT) has proven to be an important imaging modality in industry and scientific domains. Understanding the properties of material structure and behavior has produced many scientific advances. An important component of the 3D µ-CT pipeline is image partitioning (or image segmentation), a step that is used to separate various phases or components in an image. Image partitioning schemes require specific rules for different scientific fields, but a common strategy consists of devising metrics to quantify performance and accuracy. The present article proposes a set of protocols to systematically analyze and compare the results of unsupervised classification methods used for segmentation of synchrotron-based data. The proposed dataflow for Materials Segmentation and Metrics (MSM) provides 3D micro-tomography image segmentation algorithms, such as statistical region merging (SRM),               k               -means algorithm and parallel Markov random field (PMRF), while offering different metrics to evaluate segmentation quality, confidence and conformity with standards. Both experimental and synthetic data are assessed, illustrating quantitative results through the MSM dashboard, which can return sample information such as media porosity and permeability. The main contributions of this work are: (i) to deliver tools to improve material design and quality control; (ii) to provide datasets for benchmarking and reproducibility; (iii) to yield good practices in the absence of standards or ground-truth for ceramic composite analysis.},

  abstract = {Purpose:               Interest in adaptive radiation therapy research is constantly growing, but software tools available for researchers are mostly either expensive, closed proprietary applications, or free open‐source packages with limited scope, extensibility, reliability, or user support. To address these limitations, we propose SlicerRT, a customizable, free, and open‐source radiation therapy research toolkit. SlicerRT aspires to be an open‐source toolkit for RT research, providing fast computations, convenient workflows for researchers, and a general image‐guided therapy infrastructure to assist clinical translation of experimental therapeutic approaches. It is a medium into which RT researchers can integrate their methods and algorithms, and conduct comparative testing.                                         Methods:               SlicerRT was implemented as an extension for the widely used 3D Slicer medical image visualization and analysis application platform. SlicerRT provides functionality specifically designed for radiation therapy research, in addition to the powerful tools that 3D Slicer offers for visualization, registration, segmentation, and data management. The feature set of SlicerRT was defined through consensus discussions with a large pool of RT researchers, including both radiation oncologists and medical physicists. The development processes used were similar to those of 3D Slicer to ensure software quality. Standardized mechanisms of 3D Slicer were applied for documentation, distribution, and user support. The testing and validation environment was configured to automatically launch a regression test upon each software change and to perform comparison with ground truth results provided by other RT applications.                                         Results:               Modules have been created for importing and loading DICOM‐RT data, computing and displaying dose volume histograms, creating accumulated dose volumes, comparing dose volumes, and visualizing isodose lines and surfaces. The effectiveness of using 3D Slicer with the proposed SlicerRT extension for radiation therapy research was demonstrated on multiple use cases.                                         Conclusions:               A new open‐source software toolkit has been developed for radiation therapy research. SlicerRT can import treatment plans from various sources into 3D Slicer for visualization, analysis, comparison, and processing. The provided algorithms are extensively tested and they are accessible through a convenient graphical user interface as well as a flexible application programming interface.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Characterization of brain infarct lesions in rodent models of stroke is crucial to assess stroke pathophysiology and therapy outcome. Until recently, the analysis of brain lesions was performed using two techniques: (1) histological methods, such as TTC (Triphenyltetrazolium chloride), a time-consuming and inaccurate process; or (2) MRI imaging, a faster, 3D imaging method, that comes at a high cost. In the last decade, high-resolution micro-CT for 3D sample analysis turned into a simple, fast, and cheaper solution. Here, we successfully describe the application of brain contrasting agents (Osmium tetroxide and inorganic iodine) for high-resolution micro-CT imaging for fine location and quantification of ischemic lesion and edema in mouse preclinical stroke models. We used the~intraluminal transient MCAO (Middle Cerebral Artery Occlusion) mouse stroke model to identify and quantify ischemic lesion and edema, and segment core and penumbra regions at different time points after ischemia, by manual and automatic methods. In the transient-ischemic-attack (TIA) mouse model, we can quantify striatal myelinated fibers degeneration. Of note, whole brain 3D reconstructions allow brain atlas co-registration, to identify the affected brain areas, and correlate them with functional impairment. This methodology proves to be a breakthrough in the field, by providing a precise and detailed assessment of stroke outcomes in preclinical animal studies.},

  abstract = {The advent of micro-computed tomography (microCT) has provided significant advancement in our ability to generate clinically relevant assessments of lung health and disease in small animal models. As microCT use to generate outcomes analysis in pulmonary preclinical models has increased there have been substantial improvements in image quality and resolution, and data analysis software. However, there are limited published methods for standardized imaging and automated analysis available for investigators. Manual quantitative analysis of microCT images is complicated by the presence of inflammation and parenchymal disease. To improve the efficiency and limit user-associated bias, we have developed an automated pulmonary air and tissue segmentation (PATS) task list to segment lung air volume and lung tissue volume for quantitative analysis. We demonstrate the effective use of the PATS task list using four distinct methods for imaging, 1)               in vivo               respiration controlled scanning using a               flexi               Vent, 2) longitudinal breath-gated               in vivo               scanning in resolving and non-resolving pulmonary disease initiated by lipopolysaccharide-, bleomycin-, and silica-exposure, 3) post-mortem imaging, and 4)               ex vivo               high-resolution scanning. The accuracy of the PATS task list was compared to manual segmentation. The use of these imaging techniques and automated quantification methodology across multiple models of lung injury and fibrosis demonstrates the broad applicability and adaptability of microCT to various lung diseases and small animal models and presents a significant advance in efficiency and standardization of preclinical microCT imaging and analysis for the field of pulmonary research.},

Laboratory-based micro-CT scanners, laboratory-based nano-CT scanners, and integrated micro-CT/SPECT and micro-CT/PET scanners are now manufactured for “turn-key” operation by a number of commercial vendors. In recent years a number of technical developments in X-ray sources and X-ray imaging arrays have broadened the utility of micro-CT. Of particular interest are photon-counting and energy-resolving detector arrays. These are being explored to maximize micro-CT image grayscale dynamic range and to further increase image contrast by utilizing the unique spectral attenuation characteristics of individual chemical elements. X-ray phase-shift images may increase contrast resolution and reduce radiation exposure. Although radiation exposure is becoming a concern with the drive for increased spatial and temporal resolution, especially for longitudinal studies, gated scans and limited scan-data-set reconstruction algorithms show great potential for keeping radiation exposure to a minimum.},

The Dutch proton robustness evaluation protocol prescribes the dose of the clinical target volume (CTV) to the voxel-wise minimum (VWmin) dose of 28 scenarios. This results in a consistent but conservative near-minimum CTV dose (D               98\%,CTV               ). In this study, we analyzed (i) the correlation between VWmin/voxel-wise maximum (VWmax) metrics and actually delivered dose to the CTV and organs at risk (OARs) under the impact of treatment errors, and (ii) the performance of the protocol before and after its calibration with adequate prescription-dose levels.               Approach               . Twenty-one neuro-oncological patients were included. Polynomial chaos expansion was applied to perform a probabilistic robustness evaluation using 100,000 complete fractionated treatments per patient. Patient-specific scenario distributions of clinically relevant dosimetric parameters for the CTV and OARs were determined and compared to clinical VWmin and VWmax dose metrics for different scenario subsets used in the robustness evaluation protocol.               Main results               . The inclusion of more geometrical scenarios leads to a significant increase of the conservativism of the protocol in terms of clinical VWmin and VWmax values for the CTV and OARs. The protocol could be calibrated using VWmin dose evaluation levels of 93.0\%–92.3\%, depending on the scenario subset selected. Despite this calibration of the protocol, robustness recipes for proton therapy showed remaining differences and an increased sensitivity to geometrical random errors compared to photon-based margin recipes.               Significance               . The Dutch proton robustness evaluation protocol, combined with the photon-based margin recipe, could be calibrated with a VWmin evaluation dose level of 92.5\%. However, it shows limitations in predicting robustness in dose, especially for the near-maximum dose metrics to OARs. Consistent robustness recipes could improve proton treatment planning to calibrate residual differences from photon-based assumptions.},

The database includes native and contrast-enhanced, regarding spleen and liver, μCT data. All scans along with organ segmentation are freely accessible at the online repository Figshare. We encourage researchers to reuse the provided data to evaluate and improve methods and algorithms for accurate automated organ segmentation which may reduce manual segmentation effort, increase reproducibility, and even reduce the number of required laboratory animals by reducing a source of variability and having access to a reliable reference group.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based brain segmentation has recently been revolutionized by deep learning methods. These methods use large numbers of annotated segmentations to train algorithms that have the potential to perform brain segmentations reliably and quickly. However, training data for these algorithms are frequently obtained from automated brain segmentation systems, which may contain inaccurate neuroanatomy. Thus, the neuroimaging community would benefit from an open source database of high quality, neuroanatomically curated and manually edited MRI brain images, as well as the publicly available tools and detailed procedures for generating these curated data. Manual segmentation approaches are regarded as the gold standard for brain segmentation and parcellation. These approaches underpin the construction of neuroanatomically accurate human brain atlases. In addition, neuroanatomically precise definitions of MRI-based regions of interest (ROIs) derived from manual brain segmentation are essential for accuracy in structural connectivity studies and in surgical planning for procedures such as deep brain stimulation. However, manual segmentation procedures are time and labor intensive, and not practical in studies utilizing very large datasets, large cohorts, or multimodal imaging. Automated segmentation methods were developed to overcome these issues, and provide high data throughput, increased reliability, and multimodal imaging capability. These methods utilize manually labeled brain atlases to automatically parcellate the brain into different ROIs, but do not have the anatomical accuracy of skilled manual segmentation approaches. In the present study, we developed a custom software module for manual editing of brain structures in the freely available 3D Slicer software platform that employs principles and tools based on pioneering work from the Center for Morphometric Analysis (CMA) at Massachusetts General Hospital. We used these novel 3D Slicer segmentation tools and techniques in conjunction with well-established neuroanatomical definitions of subcortical brain structures to manually segment 50 high resolution T1w MRI brains from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) Young Adult database. The structural definitions used herein are associated with specific neuroanatomical ontologies to systematically interrelate histological and MRI-based morphometric definitions. The resulting brain datasets are publicly available and will provide the basis for a larger database of anatomically curated brains as an open science resource.},

  abstract = {Purpose\enspace A recently developed deep learning model (U-Net) approximated the clinical performance of radiologists in the prediction of clinically significant prostate cancer (sPC) from prostate MRI. Here, we compare the agreement between lesion segmentations by U-Net with manual lesion segmentations performed by different radiologists.             Materials and Methods\enspace 165 patients with suspicion for sPC underwent targeted and systematic fusion biopsy following 3~Tesla multiparametric MRI (mpMRI). Five sets of segmentations were generated retrospectively: segmentations of clinical lesions, independent segmentations by three radiologists, and fully automated bi-parametric U-Net segmentations. Per-lesion agreement was calculated for each rater by averaging Dice coefficients with all overlapping lesions from other raters. Agreement was compared using descriptive statistics and linear mixed models.             Results\enspace The mean Dice coefficient for manual segmentations showed only moderate agreement at 0.48–0.52, reflecting the difficult visual task of determining the outline of otherwise jointly detected lesions. U-net segmentations were significantly smaller than manual segmentations (p{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.0001) and exhibited a lower mean Dice coefficient of 0.22, which was significantly lower compared to manual segmentations (all p{$\mkern1mu<\mkern1mu$}0.0001). These differences remained after correction for lesion size and were unaffected between sPC and non-sPC lesions and between peripheral and transition zone lesions.             Conclusion\enspace Knowledge of the order of agreement of manual segmentations of different radiologists is important to set the expectation value for artificial intelligence (AI) systems in the task of prostate MRI lesion segmentation. Perfect agreement (Dice coefficient of one) should not be expected for AI. Lower Dice coefficients of U-Net compared to manual segmentations are only partially explained by smaller segmentation sizes and may result from a focus on the lesion core and a small relative lesion center shift. Although it is primarily important that AI detects sPC correctly, the Dice coefficient for overlapping lesions from multiple raters can be used as a secondary measure for segmentation quality in future studies.

  abstract = {Abstract             Proton minibeam radiation therapy (pMBRT) is a novel therapeutic strategy that has proven to significantly increase dose tolerances and sparing of normal tissue. It uses very narrow proton beams (diameter ≤1\,mm), roughly one order of magnitude smaller than state-of-the-art pencil beams. The current implementation of pMBRT with mechanical collimators is suboptimal as it is inflexible, decreases efficiency and produces additional secondary neutrons. As a potential solution, we explore in this article minibeam generation through magnetic focussing and investigate possibilities for the integration of such a technique at existing clinical centres. For this, a model of the pencil beam scanning (PBS) nozzle and beam at the Orsay Proton Therapy Centre was established and Monte Carlo simulations were performed to determine its focussing capabilities. Moreover, various modifications of the nozzle geometry were considered. It was found that the PBS nozzle in its current state is not suitable for magnetic minibeam generation. Instead, a new, optimised nozzle design has been proposed and conditions necessary for minibeam generation were benchmarked. In addition, dose simulations in a water phantom were performed which showed improved dose distributions compared to those obtained with mechanical collimators.},

  abstract = {Objective. While microCT evaluation of atherosclerotic lesions in mice has been formally validated, existing image processing methods remain undisclosed. We aimed to develop and validate a reproducible image processing workflow based on phosphotungstic acid-enhanced microCT scans for the volumetric quantification of atherosclerotic lesions in entire mouse aortas. Approach and Results. 42 WT and 42 apolipoprotein E knockout mouse aortas were scanned. The walls, lumen, and plaque objects were segmented using dual-threshold algorithms. Aortic and plaque volumes were computed by voxel counting and lesion surface by triangulation. The results were validated against manual and histological evaluations. Knockout mice had a significant increase in plaque volume compared to wild types with a plaque to aorta volume ratio of 0.3\%, 2.8\%, and 9.8\% at weeks 13, 18, and 26, respectively.

  abstract = {The Italian health system has changed its welfare model three times over the course of its 160-year existence. From a form of "residual welfare" during the liberal period (1861-1921), it became "meritocratic welfare" during the fascist period (1922-1943) and in the years of the first republic (1945-1977). Finally, in 1978, the "universalistic institutional" model of health protection was approved. For a long time, therefore, the main responsibility for citizens’ well-being was attributed to families, to the Catholic Church and its welfare networks, to entrepreneurial paternalism, and to the different health insurance institutions associated with employment sectors. Only with Law 833, which established the National Health Service (NHS), did the State recognise full and direct responsibility for citizens’ health. This paper describes the complex path that led to the establishment of the Italian NHS, highlighting the diversity of the actors involved, the multiplicity of their social and health claims, the ~configuration of the public health service designed in the 1960s, and the political and social conditions that led to the effective enactment of Law 833. On the whole, it was a long, non-linear path with various barriers, where the conditions of implementation were determined by the particularity of the Italian political, economic, and social events that characterised the 1970s.},

  abstract = {Meningeal tumors represent approximately 10–25\% of primary brain tumors and occur usually in elderly female patients. Most meningiomas are benign (80–85\%) and for symptomatic and/or large tumors, surgery, with or without radiation therapy (RT), has been long established as an effective means of local tumor control. RT can be delivered to inoperable lesions or to those with non-benign histology and for Simpson I–III and IV–V resection. RT can be delivered with photons or particles (protons or carbon ions) in stereotactic or non-stereotactic conditions. Particle therapy delivered for these tumors uses the physical properties of charged carbon ions or protons to spare normal brain tissue (i.e. Bragg peak), with or without or a dose-escalation paradigm for non-benign lesions. PT can substantially decrease the dose delivered to the non-target brain tissues, including but not limited to the hippocampi, optic apparatus or cochlea. Only a limited number of meningioma patients have been treated with PT in the adjuvant or recurrent setting, as well as for inoperable lesions with pencil beam scanning and with protons only. Approximately 500 patients with image-defined or WHO grade I meningioma have been treated with protons. The reported outcome, usually 5-year local tumor control, ranges from 85 to 99\% (median, 96\%). For WHO grade II or III patients, the outcome of only 97 patients has been published, reporting a median tumor local control rate of 52\% (range, 38–71.1). Only 24 recurring patients treated previously with photon radiotherapy and re-treated with PT were reported. The clinical outcome of these challenging patients seems interesting, provided that they presented initially with benign tumors, are not in the elderly category and have been treated previously with conventional radiation dose of photons. Overall, the number of meningioma patients treated or-re-irradiated with this treatment modality is small and the clinical evidence level is somewhat low (i.e. 3b–5). In this review, we detail the results of upfront PT delivered to patients with meningioma in the adjuvant setting and for inoperable tumors. The outcome of meningioma patients treated with this radiation modality for recurrent tumors, with or without previous RT, will also be reviewed.},

Nonetheless, to simultaneously match the exceptional performance of human vision and keep the near-eye display module compact and lightweight imposes unprecedented challenges on optical engineering. Fortunately, recent progress in holographic optical elements (HOEs) and lithography-enabled devices provide innovative ways to tackle these obstacles in AR and VR that are otherwise difficult with traditional optics. In this review, we begin with introducing the basic structures of AR and VR headsets, and then describing the operation principles of various HOEs and lithography-enabled devices. Their properties are analyzed in detail, including strong selectivity on wavelength and incident angle, and multiplexing ability of volume HOEs, polarization dependency and active switching of liquid crystal HOEs, device fabrication, and properties of micro-LEDs (light-emitting diodes), and large design freedoms of metasurfaces. Afterwards, we discuss how these devices help enhance the AR and VR performance, with detailed description and analysis of some state-of-the-art architectures. Finally, we cast a perspective on potential developments and research directions of these photonic devices for future AR and VR displays.},

  abstract = {In this study, we report our experience in commissioning a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) for fast-raster scanning of carbon-ion beams. This TPS uses an analytical dose calculation algorithm, a pencil-beam model with a triple Gaussian form for the lateral-dose distribution, and a beam splitting algorithm to consider lateral heterogeneity in a medium. We adopted the mixed beam model as the relative biological effectiveness (RBE) model for calculating the RBE values of the scanned carbon-ion beam. To validate the modeled physical dose, we compared the calculations with measurements of various relevant quantities as functions of the field size, range and width of the spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP), and depth–dose and lateral-dose profiles for a 6-mm SOBP in water. To model the biological dose, we compared the RBE calculated with the newly developed TPS to the RBE calculated with a previously validated TPS that is in clinical use and uses the same RBE model concept. We also performed patient-specific measurements to validate the dose model in clinical situations. The physical beam model reproduces the measured absolute dose at the center of the SOBP as a function of field size, range, and SOBP width and reproduces the dose profiles for a 6-mm SOBP in water. However, the profiles calculated for a heterogeneous phantom have some limitations in predicting the carbon-ion-beam dose, although the biological doses agreed well with the values calculated by the validated TPS. Using this dose model for fast-raster scanning, we successfully treated more than 900 patients from October 2018 to October 2020, with an acceptable agreement between the TPS-calculated and measured dose distributions. We conclude that the newly developed TPS can be used clinically with the understanding that it has limited accuracies for heterogeneous media.},

Despite decades of effort and many achievements, there are still challenges in feature extraction and model design. In this paper, we review the advancement in image segmentation methods systematically. According to the segmentation principles and image data characteristics, three important stages of image segmentation are mainly reviewed, which are classic segmentation, collaborative segmentation, and semantic segmentation based on deep learning. We elaborate on the main algorithms and key techniques in each stage, compare, and summarize the advantages and defects of different segmentation models, and discuss their applicability. Finally, we analyze the main challenges and development trends of image segmentation techniques.},

A relatively new effort of predictive oncology is to develop a paradigm for forecasting the future status of an individual tumor given initial conditions and an appropriate mathematical model. The objective of this study was to introduce a comprehensive multiscale computational method to predict cancer and microvascular network growth patterns. A rectangular lattice-based model was designed so different evolutionary scenarios could be simulated and for predicting the impact of diffusible factors on tumor morphology and size. Further, the model allows prediction-based simulation of cell and microvascular behavior. Like a single cell, each agent is fully realized within the model and interactions are governed in part by machine learning methods. This multiscale computational model was developed and incorporated input information from in vivo microscale computed tomography (microCT) images acquired from breast cancer-bearing mice. It was found that as the difference between expansion of the cancer cell population and microvascular network increases, cells undergo proliferation and migration with a greater probability compared to other phenotypes. Overall, multiscale computational model agreed with both theoretical expectations and experimental findings (microCT images) not used during model training.},

The scans (n\,=\,19) depict the extensive structural changes typical for female C57BL/6 mice pups, aged 1-, 3-, 7-, 10- and 14-days post-partum, as they attain the~mature geometry. We reveal the micro-morphology down to individual~trabeculae in the spine that follow phases of mineral-tissue rearrangement in the growing lumbar vertebra on a micrometer length scale. Phantom data is provided to facilitate mineral density calibration. Conventional histomorphometry matched with our micro-CT data on selected samples confirms the validity and accuracy of our 3D scans. The data may thus serve as a reference for modeling normal bone growth and can be used to benchmark other experiments assessing the effects of biomaterials, tissue growth, healing, and regeneration.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Proton beam treatment is being looked favourably now in breast treatment. Tissue expanders are often placed after mastectomy that contains metallic port for saline injection which produces dose perturbations in proton beam therapy with uncertain dosimetry. Dose perturbation for a stainless-steel injection port from a breast implant is investigated in this study. Measurements, Monte-Carlo simulation, and calculated dose distribution of plans based on kVCT and MVCT images are compared. Treatment plans are performed on kVCT and MVCT images to observe the effect of metal artifact from the breast implant. The kVCT based plan underestimates the beam range due to the overestimated water equivalent thickness of the metal ports as a result of image degradation. Compared to the measurement with metal port in the proton beam, the MVCT-based treatment planning provides more accurate dose calculation than the kVCT-based results. The dose perturbation factor calculated from MVCT planning is within 10\% of the measurement results while HU corrected kVCT plan still shows dose difference as large as 100\% due to the incorrect range pull back calculation caused by the misrepresentation of the volume between the plastic cap and the stainless-steel base. The dose enhancement observed at the metal and solid water interface is as large as 15\%, which needs to be accounted for in the planning process if there is a clinical concern. Dose reduction as large as 16\% is observed with depth from 1 cm to 4 cm underneath the thickest part of the metallic port whereas lateral dose perturbation is also seen up to 7 mm. The measurement data are supported by the Monte-Carlo simulated results with a maximum dose difference of 6\%. It is concluded that if proton beam is used with metallic port, MVCT imaging data is recommended. In lieu of MVCT, DECT, CT scanner with metal artifact reduction software or in the very least, extended HU range should be used to reduce the streaking artifact as well as to produce a more accurate image of the metallic port.}
