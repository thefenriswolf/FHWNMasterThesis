	\noindent
	First and foremost, I would like to thank my supervisor \advisor for his invaluable feedback.
	Furthermore, I wish to thank my partner for her unconditional support and patience as well as my parents for their never ending support for all my ventures in live.
	Additionally, I want to thank my dear friend Evelin Reichel, MA (for making sure my ramblings are at least coherent).
	Finally, I would like to thank David Kovacs, MA as he did not hesitate to help a complete stranger accomplish writing a thesis in LaTeX.
