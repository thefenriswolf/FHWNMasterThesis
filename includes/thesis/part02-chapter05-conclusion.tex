\chapter{Discussion}\label{c:discussion}
This chapter provides an overview of the relevance and interpretation of the results in \cref{c:results}.
However, due to the fact that this study has a small number of participants (n=\numberofTesters),
it has to be noted that a statistical significance of the results has not achieved.
Similar to \citeauthor{andersenAccuracyPrecisionManual2018}, segmentation accuracy will be interpreted via overlap using the \acrfull{dc}, where $90\%$ overlap will be considered as \textit{excellent overlap}.
As well as, border distance using the \acrfull{hd}, where $0.4mm$\footnote{$4$ times the voxel size of $0.1mm$} will be considered as \textit{acceptable agreement}.\\
Furthermore, \cref{c:conclusion} provides a final conclusion of the topics covered by this thesis.\\
Finally, \cref{c:future} discusses possible future research.\\

\noindent
The following sections (\cref{s:seg-eval-scapula} - \cref{s:seg-eval-humerus}) feature tables (\cref{tab:scapula-overlap} - \cref{tab:humerus-distance}), which provide an overview of segmentation improvements for each test person, separated by segmented anatomy and comparison metric.
Where the values shown in the tables reflect the difference of their segmentation accuracy between pre- and post-guide performance.

% \section{Evaluation: \acrlong{dc}}
% The \acrfull{dc} which effectively describes the relative overlap of 2 segments showed an improvement for 15 out of 21 (3 segments * 7 testers) (71.43\%) segmentations.\\ %\section{Evaluation: \acrlong{hd}}
% The \acrfull{hd}, which effectively describes the absolute distance between two segments showed the following improvements:\\
% Maximum distance:\\
% 17 out of 21 (80.95\%)\\
% Average distance:\\
% 14 out of 21 (66.66\%)

\section{Segmentation evaluation: Scapula}\label{s:seg-eval-scapula}
As can be seen in \cref{tab:scapula-overlap} segmentation of the scapula with the guide improved in six out of seven testers.
On average the segmentation overlap between the ground truth and test person's segmentation increased by $13.57\%$.
Therefore, six out of seven testers seem to have benefited from reading the guide when tasked with segmenting a mouse scapula when comparing their performance using the \glsxtrlong{dc}.

\section{Interpretation and comparison with Literature}
\Citeauthor{andersenAccuracyPrecisionManual2018} compared manual segmentation between MRI and CT scans of the same patients by different operators and defined the results via the \acrlong{dc} and \acrlong{hd}.
They defined a \acrshort{dc} value of $0.9$ or $90\%$ as \textit{excellent agreement}.
Furthermore, they defined a border distance (\acrshort{hd}) equal to 4 times the acquired voxel size as \textit{acceptable agreement} \cite{andersenAccuracyPrecisionManual2018}.
In this study the author introduces the term of \textit{acceptable agreement} for the \acrshort{dc} for an overlap of $80\%$.

\noindent
Referring back to \cref{c:results}, \textit{excellent agreement} after reading the guide,
according to the \acrlong{dc} was achieved by test person 4 for all tree anatomical structures,
test person 6 for humerus segmentation
and test person 7 for clavicle and humerus segmentation.
Therefore, the highest agreement after reading the guide was achieved for humerus segmentation by $42.86\%$ of testers (see: \cref{tab:dc-excellent}).

Therefore, the highest agreement after reading the guide was achieved for humerus segmentation by $100\%$ of testers (see: \cref{tab:dc-acceptable}).
Second-highest agreement was achieved for clavicle segmentation by $57.15\%$ of testers.

\chapter{Conclusion and Limitations}\label{c:conclusion}
The main goal of this thesis was to determine, whether inexperienced people facing a \mct\space segmentation task benefit from reading a guide beforehand.
This is relevant because segmentation is an important step in quantitative image analysis studies.
Giving researchers a head start in segmentation tasks would likely improve segmentation speed and accuracy.
In this study, a guide, describing segmentation of mouse bone anatomy in \mct\space datsets, was created.
The guide was handed out to testers with the task of performing segmentation without any help from the guide on 3 bones.
And then repeating the task on the contralateral side with the help of the guide.
The resulting segmentations were compared to a gold standard segmentation and analyzed.
Due to the small sample size, it was not possible to show a significant statistical improvement of segmentations.
However, the results indicate, that if this experiment were to be repeated with a large number of testers, segmentation accuracy improvements would be evident.
In conclusion, this thesis failed to show statistical significant improvements due to a small sample size.
Future research could however, reliably answer the research question of whether the usage of a segmentation guide improves segmentation quality when used by inexperienced people.


\section*{Future Research}\label{c:future}
This thesis provides a basis for future research in medical imaging segmentation documentation and guidance.
Further points of research can be inferred from the limitations described in \cref{c:conclusion}.\\
First and foremost, as this paper only managed to gather results from a limited number\footnote{n=\numberofTesters} of testers, the issue with tester participation needs to be addressed in follow-up research.
This could be solved via the following steps.
Firstly, allocating more time for testers to perform the task.
And secondly, trying to engage more testes to start with.\\
Secondly, the segmentation performance of different guide structures may be evaluated by strategic \textit{A/B testing} like described by \citeauthor{brataUserExperienceImprovement2020}.
Whereby, testers are unknowingly divided into two groups.
Version A of a guide is handed out to group A and version B of a guide is handed out to group B.
By comparing the performance of the two groups, the performance of different guide formats can be indirectly evaluated.\\
Furthermore, to ensure a consistent bone mask across all testing participants a fixed HU threshold range should be defined \cite{chavezGuidelinesMicroComputed2021}.\\
Therefore, more research is needed to answer the research question, whether inexperienced users benefit from a segmentation guide.
