\section{Introduction}
\begin{body}
	Micro computed tomography ($\mu$CT) is a widely used modality in industry and research. For the latter it enables the study of small structures in animals, for example rodents such as mice.\cite{percianoInsight3DMicroCT2017}.
	A common task while performing short term or long term studies with mice is the segmentation of the image data, as it is a important step for quantitative image analysis\cite{sheppardTechniquesHelicalScanning2014}. Segmentation can be defined as the process of separating various image components and extracting parts that are of interest for later analysis\cite{percianoInsight3DMicroCT2017}.
	\newline
	There exist a few free and open-source programs capable of segmenting $\mu$CT datasets.
	The two actively maintained and well known\cite{mandoliniComparisonThree3D2022,virziComprehensiveReview3D2020} software packages are:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[\ding{108}] \textsc{ITK-SNAP}\cite{yushkevichUserguided3DActive2006} available under the \texttt{GNU General Public License}\cite{licenseGnuGeneralPublic1989}
		\item[\ding{108}] \textsc{3D Slicer}\cite{kikinis3DSlicerPlatform2014} available under a \texttt{BSD style license}\cite{gaudeulPublicProvisionPrivate2005}
	\end{itemize}
	Both provide the user with a plethora of segmentation algorithms which can be grouped into manual, semi-automatic and fully automatic. They provide several tools capable of complex segmentation workflows\cite{percianoInsight3DMicroCT2017}.
	Accuracy and efficiency of the segmentation however strongly depend on user experience and the segmentation algorithm chosen\cite{mandoliniComparisonThree3D2022,aydinRELIABILITYREPRODUCIBILITYTIMEEFFICIENCY2020}.
\end{body}

\section{Problem Statement}
\begin{body}
	As mentioned above \texttt{3D Slicer} and \texttt{ITK-SNAP} provide the user with a sizable amount of segmentation tools and the selection of the correct segmentation algorithm and workflow have a non negligible influence on the segmentation quality as well as the time the user has to spend on it.
	Therefore, we hypothesize that users of \texttt{3D Slicer} will benefit from a streamlined segmentation guide and it will improve segmentation quality as well as workflow efficiency.

\section{Literature to be reviewed}
\begin{body}
	The source of literature used for this master thesis are PubMed, ScienceDirect IEEE Xplore and the meta search engine Google Scholar.
	The main workflow of searching for appropriate literature was to search for publications covering the defined keywords\ref{s:Keywords} in the abstract, reading as many of the papers as possible and filtering out the most relevant.
	The following papers are the result of this workflow at the current time:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[\ding{108}] Comparison of segmentation tools for structural analysis of bone tissues by finite elements (Argüello et al. \textsf{\textbf{Journal of Physics}})
		\item[\ding{108}] Comprehensive Review of 3D Segmentation Software Tools for MRI Usable for Pelvic Surgery Planning (Virzì et al. \textsf{\textbf{Journal of Digital Imaging}})
		\item[\ding{108}] Comparison of Three 3D Segmentation Software Tools for Hip Surgical Planning (Mandolini et al. \textsf{\bfseries{MDPI}})
		\item[\ding{108}] Morphological mouse phenotyping: anatomy, histology and imaging (Ruberte et al. \textsf{\bfseries{Academic Press}})
		\item[\ding{108}] User-guided 3D active contour segmentation of anatomical structures: Significantly improved efficiency and reliability (Yushkevich et al. \textsf{\bfseries{NeuroImage}})
		\item[\ding{108}] Medical image segmentation on GPUs – A comprehensive review (Smistad et al. \textsf{\bfseries{Medical Image Analysis}})
		\item[\ding{108}] Segmentation and Visual Analysis of Whole-Body Mouse Skeleton microSPECT (Khmelinskii et al. \textsf{\bfseries{PLoS ONE}})
		\item[\ding{108}] SlicerRT: Radiation therapy research toolkit for 3D Slicer (Pinter et al. \textsf{\bfseries{Medical Physics}})
		\item[\ding{108}] Insight into 3D micro-CT data: exploring segmentation algorithms through performance metrics (Perciano et al. \textsf{\bfseries{Journal of Synchrotron Radiation}})
		\item[\ding{108}] SAMM (Segment Any Medical Model): A 3D Slicer Integration to SAM (Liu et al. \textsf{\bfseries{Johns Hopkins University}})

	\end{itemize}

\section{Research design and Methods}
\begin{body}
	The practical work for this project will be completed by the author on his private computer.
	The first step will be the segmentation of the $\mu$CT scans which will serve as a ground truth and finding possible efficient workflows with the tools included in \texttt{3D Slicer}.
	Then a guide will be created outlining 2-3 different possible workflows for bone segmentation.
	This guide will be handed out to test candidates in conjunction with the task of using the guide to segment a specific part of a scan volume.
	The candidates are asked to perform the segmentation and return their results to the author, who will then calculate their accuracy by comparing the result of each test candidate with his own segmentation. A qualitative score of the segmentations will be created by computing a score like the Hausdorff distance\cite{birsanOneHundredYears2006} or the Dice coefficient\cite{diceMeasuresAmountEcologic1945}.

\end{body}

\section{Outcome}
\begin{body}
	As creating as general segmentation guide for $\mu$CT scans of mice and educating the user on every possible segmentation method for every tissue is far beyond the capabilities of this master thesis, the outcome should be twofold:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Educating users of segmentation software like 3D Slicer on the capabilities and correct usage of their tools
		\item Enabling further research on the topic of $\mu$CT segmentation for different tissues
	\end{enumerate}
\end{body}
