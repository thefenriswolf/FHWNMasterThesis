The summary should include a few lines about the background information, the main research question or problem that you want to write about, and your research methods. The proposal summary should not contain any references or citations. Remember that your entire proposal cannot exceed 1500 words, so choose the words in this section carefully. The 1500 words you will write in the proposal document will exclude any words contained in the tables, figures, and references. You can use this template for writing your proposal.
